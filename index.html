     <li><span id=p>2 Mar 2009 &raquo; </span><font size=+1>Assembly Notes</font><ul>
		  <li>I missed a power plug on the mobo that was specifically for the cpu, computer is dead w/out that.</li>
		  <li>I installed all 4 ram sticks, and one was bad, computer is dead if that happens.</li>
		  <li>when first loading the bios, use 1 stick of ram, and as little else as possible to reduce errors.</li>
		  <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=74F9865BA5CA7304">crucial.com</a> has great customer service and sent me a ups label for the return, and told me to bubble wrap the sticks, since I had thrown out the plastic cases.</li>
		  <li>this mobo did not have a vga connection. a first for me.</li>
		  <li>the power supply unit only had 2 sata plugs.  I have to buy converters for the rest.  Next time I would get one w/ more sata plugs.</li>
		  <li>had to buy a dvd drive, and an IDE dvd drive fits better with the cables/plugs layout than a SATA dvd drive with my setup.</li>
		  </ul></li><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <li><span id=p>28 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span><font size=+1>Case</font><ul>
		  <li>LOVE THIS CASE</li>
		  <li>Power supply sits on the floor, leaving ample room to navigate the motherboard. natural to have the weight at the bottom.</li>
		  <li>easy access, comes with lots of extra screws, especially the large thumb screws.</li>
		  </ul></li><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <li><span id=p>28 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span><font size=+1>Painting Notes</font><ul>
		  <li>use blue painter's tape and waxed paper to cover the areas that you do not want to paint.</li>
		  <li>I decided not to paint the inside of the 5.25" bays because there were some wires that needed to be taped off in that area.</li>
		  <li>fill screw holes with toothpcks</li>
		  <li>when spray painting the case, only do one side at a time, making sure the side is flat to the ground so that gravity won't create any drips if you spray too heavy.</li>
		  <li>Plexiglass:<ul>
			  <li>I got the thinner plexiglass (1/8"), worked very well fitting into the edge grooves.</li>
			  <li>A co-worked helped to drill the holes for the fan and also a handle.  The handle area cracked, and we put in a reinforcement piece.</li>
			  <li>If you use the same case, the plexiglass cut was a 16" and 5/8" square.  However, I would go a bit short (1/8"-1/4")on one side to not make it so tight.</li>
			  <li>Got the plexiglass at Lowes and they cut it for me, perfectly.</li>
			  </ul></li>
		  <li>I used less than one can of metal primer (2 coats)</li>
		  <li>needed 2 cans of the color spray paint</li>
		  <li>painting the fan vents on the case leaked the color, and I went back to spray a black touch up coat on the flip side.</li>
		  <li>it took me about 8 days.  I believe in ample drying time between coats.</li>
		  <li>All in all I am <strong>extremely</strong> pleased with how it turned out.</li>
		  </ul>
      </li><br><!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <li><span id=p>24 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span>The last of the ordered parts arrived today. I will still need a video and sound card, and eventually a decent network adaptor card. But for now, I can get a functioning machine. Will finish up the painting and see about replacing the side panel with plexiglass this weekend. I have no intention of cutting the side panel, so if plexiglass doesn't secure nicely as a replacement, then the lime color will be a secret.</li><br>
      <li><span id=p>22 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span>Took apart, (blue) taped and primed the interior of the case.</li><br>
      <li><span id=p>18 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span>Watched <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dhwr4601Gg">this</a> and decided to paint the interior of my case lime green.</li><br>

      <li><span id=p>16 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span>Overwhelmed with building my own, gave the T100 another try.
      <br>The Dell propriety boot sector was loaded when I tried to install the OS. This confirmed my decision to return the T100.</li><br>
      <li><span id=p>13 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span>T100 arrived. There are no PCIe x16 ports on the mobo (only x1, x4 and x8 which are fairly worthless slots).
      <br>Decided to return T100 and build my own. Off the shelf servers are not made to accommodate video or sound. Also a server quality machine is meant to be stored in a noisy server room and no effort is made to make it a quiet system. A custom build will hopefully solve these issues so I can run it in a home office.</li><br>
      <li><span id=p>07 Feb 2009 &raquo; </span>Ordered a Dell PowerEdge T100.</li>
